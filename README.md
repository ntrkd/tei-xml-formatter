This project is under active development and is not ready for use.

## What is this?

This repository contains the code for a VSCode extension that formats [TEI XML](https://tei-c.org/) files to be more human readable. It uses [saxes](https://github.com/lddubeau/saxes/) currently to parse XML files and converts the nodes back into text. This formatter expects valid XML files.
